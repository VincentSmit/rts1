\begin{homeworkSection}{Exercise 1}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l}
	& $C_i$ & $T_i$ \\
	\hline
	$\tau_1$ & 2,5 & 5 \\
	\hline
	$\tau_2$ & 4 & 9 \\
\end{tabular}

For the LL-bound check, we need to know the least upperbound for this schedule. Since we have two tasks, equation \ref{eq:lub} has to be calculated for two tasks.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:lub}
\begin{split}
U_{lub} &= 2*(2^{1/n}-1)\\
		&= 0.828
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Then, for the bound check we need the utilization factor. If this value is smaller than the $U_{lub}$, 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:util}
\begin{split}
U 	& = \sum_{i=1}^2 \frac{C_i}{T_i} \\
	& = \frac{2,5}{5} + \frac{4}{9}\\
	& = \frac{17}{18}\\
	& = 0.944....\\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

This is clearly greater than 0.828, therefore the schedule is not feasible according to the LL bound.

So then for the schedule to be feasible according to the HB bound, the result of equation \ref{eq:util_hb}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:util_hb}
\begin{split}
\prod_{i=1}^{2} (U_{i} + 1) & = 1\frac{1}{2} * 1\frac{4}{9} \\
		& = \frac{13}{6}	
\end{split} 	
\end{equation} 

This is larger than 2, therefore the schedule is not feasible according to the HB bound.
